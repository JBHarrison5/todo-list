# To Do List 

This is a simple to-do list application that allows you to log tasks, edit the tasks, mark tasks as done and permanently delete tasks. It was built using PHP with the Slim 4 framework and styled using bootstrap. The database was implemented with mySQL.
This was a really interesting project to get to grips with the slim framework.

This skeleton application used was built for Composer which made set quick and easy.
